The field of Computer Science (CS) manages to impact an innumerable amount of
disciplines along the spectrum of Arts and Sciences. Despite making up only 8.1%
of degree recipients in 2012[@degr], the field of computer science has made an
indelible mark on almost every other field imaginable. Across so many
disparate applications of CS, developers need a method of communication that
allows for growth of the field that binds them. Thankfully, the proliferation of
home computers and the internet has only strengthened the bond that the CS community
shares today. Many tools of communication exist already, and more are being
produced every day. One tool can spawn a multiplicity of communities, each
wholly distinct from the next. Another tool can be used as more of a soapbox where
declarations of principle and value are archived for public viewing. Targeted
discussion is the ultimate goal, and many communities require strict moderation
to ensure that a culture of positive discourse can be achieved. Academic
Journals serve as a repository of growth made in pushing the boundaries of the
CS field, and many aspects of Theoretical Computation resemble those of
Mathematics, both of which are intertwined. Growth in the field of CS[@mit0] can be
demonstrated by the level of communication and discourse which its members have
the ability to cultivate.


With the immense variety of communication tools, an aspiring member of discourse
must have the wherewithal to probe for and discover new communities. More often
than not, communities reference one another and support a sort of cross
pollination between groups. Where some communities encourage the sharing of
personal information among a real-world friend group, others encourage
pseudonymity or even total anonymity. 
The type of content that can be shared on one tool can fundamentally affect the type of
community that arises. Linksharing sites are built on the foundation of
connecting users to the panoply of nodes that comprise the internet. The content
of a linksharing site is discovery in new corners of the web. Hacker News[@hn], one
of the most potent examples of linksharing, proves itself to be valuable to CS
professionals of many kinds. Run by the startup incubator Y Combinator[@yc], its name
a reference to a fundamental element in Theoretical Computation, Hacker News
boasts a vibrant society of startup founders, engineers, students, and computing
enthusiasts. Content submitted for public approval is evaluated, and the power
to collectively support or reject content allows users to play a role in
the curation of content which represents the interests of the group as a
whole. This democratization of sharing allows the most relevant and useful
information to rise while noisy or frivolous information languishes.


With so many means of online communication, academic journal articles serve as a
sharp contrast in terms of barrier to entry. While contribution to discourse
online is, relatively, effortless, the barrage of rules, guidelines, and peer
reviews prevent all but the most motivated CS students and academics from
article submission. A frequent reader of academic journals likened good articles
to, "a compelling story", that avoid, "trying to cover too many unrelated topics or ideas."[@acint] 
As a well written novel might have a central theme and follow a narrative
structure, so too are journal articles more intriguing when the focus on
subject matter is tight and the writing has a formal structure.
Another journal reader described how important it is to, "convince readers in
the beginning that your work is important and worth reading, otherwise they will
quickly become disinterested and stop reading."[@agint]
The high amount of effort required to produce an accepted
journal article ensures that the level of quality and thought put into the
subject matter is worthy of pursuit by a potential reader. The journal ACM
Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology seeks to publish,
"papers on all aspects of designing and building large, complex
software systems: specification, design, development and maintenance", [@acmse]
and has been doing so since 1992. One sample article from this journal
"Automatic Workarounds: Exploiting the Intrinsic Redundancy
of Web Applications", elaborates on a method of creating web applications that
are robust and sturdy through the utilization of principles inherent to the
domain of web development. This ACM journal can take a relatively broad scope of
subject matter and deliver it to its audience.
Journals can also be incredibly nuanced and tailored to a specific application of CS,
one such example being the MIT Press Computer Music journal. Founded in 1977, the Computer
Music Journal prides itself on being an, "essential resource for musicians,
composers, scientists, engineers, computer enthusiasts and anyone exploring the
wonders of computer-generated sound".[@mitpresscomj] This tight focus on
electro-musical subject matter allows the Computer Music Journal to provide
robust and fascinating developments in a subset of CS that may not often be
popular. One article entitled "Buttons, Handles, and Keys: Advances in Continuous-Control 
Keyboard Instruments" describes an augmentation to digital keyboards where a
touch sensitive overlay is placed over each key, allowing for controls over
any arbitrary parameter, for instance pitch bend, volume, or resonance[@mit0]. In this
article, the author provides historical context, implementation details, and
additional applications of this technology, each a hallmark of academic
papers. In order to submit this paper to the[@acint] MIT Press for evaluation, the
author had to follow a strict set of guidelines not limited to a 45 page style
and spelling guide, Chicago citation styling, and anonymous submission.
