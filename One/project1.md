The study of Computer Science (Computer Science) has continued to accelerate in growth since its
early roots in the notebooks of Charles Babbage, the halls of Bletchly Park, and
the practical pioneering of Grace Hopper. It is thanks to computers and computer
science that so many basic conveniences are available in the modern world, and it
is nearly impossible to find a discipline that has not been positively
influenced by computers in one way or another. The inherent modularity and
adaption of computing to affect other fields of study promotes a level of
interdisciplinarity whereby contributions to a non-Computer Science field can tangentially and
simultaneously progress the study of Computer Science. With such an abstract and amorphous
effect, Computer Science had to find a way to foster collaboration among the numerous fields
that were all connected by the application of computers.
The field of Computer Science manages to impact an innumerable amount of
disciplines along the spectrum of Arts and Sciences. Despite making up only 8.1%
of degree recipients in 2012[@degr], the field of computer science has made an
indelible mark on almost every other field imaginable. Across so many
disparate applications of Computer Science, developers need a method of communication that
allows for growth of the field that binds them. Thankfully, the proliferation of
home computers and the internet has only strengthened the bond that the Computer Science community
shares today. Many tools of communication exist already, and more are being
produced every day. One tool can spawn a multiplicity of communities, each
wholly distinct from the next. Another tool can be used as more of a soapbox where
declarations of principle and value are archived for public viewing. Targeted
discussion is the ultimate goal, and many communities require strict moderation
to ensure that a culture of positive discourse can be achieved. Academic
Journals serve as a repository of growth made in pushing the boundaries of the
Computer Science field, and many aspects of Theoretical Computation resemble those of
Mathematics, both of which are intertwined. Growth in the field of Computer Science can be
demonstrated by the level of communication and discourse which its members have
the ability to cultivate.
The field of Computer Science relies primarily on internet communities and journal
articles to maintain a high level of growth in a culture of interdisciplinarity. 


With so many means of online communication, academic journal articles serve as a
sharp contrast in terms of barrier to entry. While contribution to discourse
online is, relatively, effortless, the barrage of rules, guidelines, and peer
reviews prevent all but the most motivated Computer Science students and academics from
article submission. A frequent reader of academic journals likened good articles
to, "a compelling story", that avoid, "trying to cover too many unrelated topics or ideas."[@acint] 
As a well written novel might have a central theme and follow a narrative
structure, so too are journal articles more intriguing when the focus on
subject matter is tight and the writing has a formal structure.
This structure, which can be seen in most articles, boils down to, "(1)
abstract, (2) introduction and motivation, (3) overview of the work, (4)
detailed description of methods, (5) experimental results and discussion, (6)
related work, (7) conclusion, (8) citations, and (9) appendices"[@agint].
Though some of these sections can be reordered,  this
structure provides a progression of logic that the reader can more easily
follow.
Another journal reader described how important it is to, "convince readers in
the beginning that your work is important and worth reading, otherwise they will
quickly become disinterested and stop reading."[@agint]
Style, structure, and logical progression are all hallmarks of an impactful
and literate piece of writing.
The high amount of effort required to produce an accepted
journal article ensures that the level of quality and thought put into the
subject matter is worthy of pursuit by a potential reader. 

Closer inspection of the submission guidelines in major academic journals can
provide insight to the real hurdles that must be jumped in the process to have
an article published.
The journal ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology seeks to publish,
"papers on all aspects of designing and building large, complex
software systems: specification, design, development and maintenance", [@acmse]
and has been doing so since 1992. One sample article from this journal
"Automatic Workarounds: Exploiting the Intrinsic Redundancy
of Web Applications", elaborates on a method of creating web applications that
are robust and sturdy through the utilization of principles inherent to the
domain of web development. This ACM journal can take a relatively broad scope of
subject matter and deliver it to its audience.
Journals can also be incredibly nuanced and tailored to a specific application of Computer Science,
one such example being the MIT Press Computer Music journal. Founded in 1977, the Computer
Music Journal prides itself on being an, "essential resource for musicians,
composers, scientists, engineers, computer enthusiasts and anyone exploring the
wonders of computer-generated sound"[@mitpresscomj]. This tight focus on
electro-musical subject matter allows the Computer Music Journal to provide
robust and fascinating developments in a subset of Computer Science that may not often be
popular. One article entitled "Buttons, Handles, and Keys: Advances in Continuous-Control 
Keyboard Instruments" describes an augmentation to digital keyboards where a
touch sensitive overlay is placed over each key, allowing for controls over
any arbitrary parameter, for instance pitch bend, volume, or resonance[@mit0]. In this
article, the author provides historical context, implementation details, and
additional applications of this technology, each a hallmark of academic
papers. In order to submit this paper to the MIT Press for evaluation, the
author had to follow a strict set of guidelines not limited to a 45 page style
and spelling guide, Chicago citation styling, and anonymous
submission[@mitpresscomjguide]. 



With the immense variety of communication tools, an aspiring member of discourse
must have the wherewithal to probe for and discover new communities. More often
than not, communities reference one another and support a sort of cross
pollination between groups. Where some communities encourage the sharing of
personal information among a real-world friend group, others encourage
pseudonymity or even total anonymity. 
The type of content that can be shared on one tool can fundamentally affect the type of
community that arises. Linksharing sites are built on the foundation of
connecting users to the panoply of nodes that comprise the internet. The content
of a linksharing site is discovery in new corners of the web. *Hacker News*[@hn], one
of the most potent examples of linksharing, proves itself to be valuable to Computer Science
professionals of many kinds. Run by the startup incubator Y Combinator[@yc], its name
a reference to a fundamental element in Theoretical Computation, *Hacker News*
boasts a vibrant society of startup founders, engineers, students, and computing
enthusiasts. Content submitted for public approval is evaluated, and the power
to collectively support or reject content allows users to play a role in
the curation of content which represents the interests of the group as a
whole. This democratization of sharing allows the most relevant and useful
information to rise while noisy or frivolous information languishes; however,
this user-driven moderation is not foolproof. In any human society, a major threat
will always be social manipulation, and online societies are no different.
When the only preview an HN user can see is a short one line description, the
submitter must decide how exactly to advertise the content being promoted.
Operated by a startup incubator, *Hacker News'* content is understandably
entrepreneurial, and in many cases, submissions are simply product
advertisements. Alternately, other submissions are of a more educational or
collaborative nature. Links to open source projects, tutorials, and, in some
cases, academic journals. Ranking in the top 15 posts of all times[@hntl], the
post *The Heartbleed Bug* outlines the cause and effect of a severe security
vulnerability that affected (and continues to affect) computers around the
world[@hbb]. Though not written in a scholarly style, it reads very much like
an academic article. It begins with an overview, defines some basic terminology,
describes the main problem, and provides a solution along with plans for future
action; additionally, a list of references proceeds the main text.


Interdisciplinarity, or, the ability to transcend the rigid boundaries of
academic disciplines, is a fundamental application of Computer Science.
Beginning its life as a subset of Mathematics, CS itself became an
interdiscipline and over time became, "like a discipline, developing its own
curriculum, journals, professional associations, and ... perspective"[@repko].
