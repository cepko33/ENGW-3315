Form metal bellows and how to maximize certain aspects of its design. FEA
(Finite Element Analysis) software is used to model the differences in
parameters and then analyze what the effect of each difference causes.
Successful designs are produced and tested in the real world. Changes include
total size, number of ruffles in the bellows, and materials.

Information Distortion in a Supply Chain
Bullwhip effect - demand vs actual ability to supply. Demand is difficult to
predict. What are the causes and indication that it is happening? Rationing
leads to higher demand but unused product when stockpiles are made as a result.
Anomalies in the supply/demand chain can echo through the system and
dramatically affect how each end, from manufacturing to shipping, is affected.
