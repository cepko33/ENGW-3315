Re: Article Analysis


I have read your analysis of an article which discusses changes in the
manufacturing of metal bellows as written by Faraji, Besharati, Mosavi, and
Kashanizadeh. You use Johns' ten characteristics to determine how well it
satisfies a set of academic standards. As a conclusion to the abstract, you lay
out exactly which characteristics the article follows and which it doesn't.

In this first few paragraphs, you have a few spelling and grammar mistakes,
including Ann Johns' name not being used as a possessive, and a few instances of
'modelled' instead of 'modeled'; however, these kinds of errors are few and far between.

Your discussion of the introduction is short and to the point, citing a
definition from Johns and a synopsis of the introductory section.
For an analysis of the metadiscourse of the article, you show a number of
examples from the text that fit the part of guiding signposts.
I'm glad you summarized these two aspects so tersely, both are very cut and dry
from an analytic perspective.

The section on writing to a specific audience has an array of examples and
justifications from Johns' text, and I have no real critiques as it is very
thorough.

When describing the aspects of hedging that your article engenders, it seems
strange that there are no notable instances of hedging, even from the
introduction or future work sections. An example of hedging in a non-concrete
part of the article might be enlightening.

Your description of genre requirements is very cut and dry as well. The section
concerning vision of reality paints the picture of a very pragmatic and
realistic point of view in the case of this engineering article.

Overall, I'd suggest adding a few more citations including one for the website
listing common phrases in metadiscourse.
