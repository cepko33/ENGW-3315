# Summary

Keyboards are incredibly expressive and versatile instruments, but any attempt
to modify parameters other requires the musician to remove their hands from the
keys. TouchKeys provides a solution to give the musician continuous control over
two extra parameters without having to take their hands from the keyboard
itself. Capacitive touch-sensitive stickers are placed on each key, and the
placement of a finger on the sticker is translated from X-Y data to MIDI
parameter controls then sent to a computer. Parameters controlled can vary from
pitch shifting to provide an artificial vibrato, intensity of reverberation, or
release length. These stickers add two more dimensions of control to the
keyboard and allow a musician the ability to be even more expressive.[@mit0]

# Analysis

*Buttons, Handles and Keys:
Advances in Continuous-Control Keyboard Instruments* (BHK) 
authored by Andrew McPherson, is not a quintessential journal article, but it is
an excellent example of interdisciplinarity in the computer science,
engineering, and music fields. While it may not strictly follow the traditional
scholarly article structure, it tells the story of a novel innovation in musical
expression while retaining many of the stylistic aspects of an article. Though
the conceit of the article revolves around the TouchKeys product and
substantially recounts the journey embarked upon by the author to create this product,
the language used to describe the technology and the structure of the article
itself is indistinguishable from any other journal article. Johns' rules for
academic discourse convey a very strict set of guidelines for scholarly
articles, and while BHK may not take exactly the same approach as Johns would,
it holds the same amount of value in the field of computer science.

## Introduction

As any competent journal article should start, BHK
begins with an introduction. Initially, a distinction is made between a button and a
handle, both simple controls for a user that are fundamentally different in
their expressiveness. Where a button allows only for a binary on state or off
state, a handle is ambiguous and analog in the range of states it
provides[@mit0]. Being able to understand the meaning of the title is the
foremost concern for the reader, and McPherson explicitly understands this.
McPherson then observes that the, "musical keyboard presents an interesting cross
between buttons and handles"[@mit0], and then goes on to describe how the
melding of these two seemingly exclusive controls are fundamental aspects of the
piano, organ, and other keyboard instruments.  


Johns observes that the, "topic and argument should be prerevealed in the
introduction,"[@johns] and McPherson follows suit.
The introduction enumerates the history of augmented keyboards that add new
parameters to the handle control and then states the main purpose of the article
which is to explore, "advances in the design of keyboards featuring continuous
control of one or more musical dimensions", and then to describe McPherson's
implementation of a new "musical dimension". The introduction to BHK shows all
of the signs of strong academic effort.

## Audience Assumption

McPherson assumes very little of his audience, but he trusts readers to be aware
of the musical world and specifically the operation of keyboard instruments.
Understanding of essential hardware and basic electronic instrument elements is also
assumed, so terms like "MIDI" not being defined could be a detriment to a casual
reader; however, for the most part, technical jargon is kept to a minimum and
most specific terms are defined for the edification of the audience.


## Metadiscourse

Found mostly in the introduction, the phrase, "this article", is used to guide
the reader through the act of parsing BHK. Johns implores that writers should
provide, "'maps' or 'signposts'" that "assist readers in predicting and
summarizing texts"[@johns].
While self reference is not the most
elegant method of structuring an article, it can provide helpful markers to
bring a struggling reader back from an overwhelmed state. When McPherson wants
to make a connection from one section to another that does not immediately
proceed it, he either uses an aside, guiding the reader to , "(see the Augmented Instruments
section of this article)"[@mit0], or foreshadows that, "The Mappings section,
later in this article, discusses possible relationships,"[@mit0]. Additionally,
McPherson addresses the audience in predicting that, "we will see a greater
adoption of new keyboard instruments in the coming years"[@mit0]. While not
necessarily leading the reader to another part of the article, that passage inspires
further thought about the potential applications of TouchKeys and allows the
reader a clearer view of the invention itself.

## Hedging

Because the article discusses some very concrete topics with a tangible
application, very little hedging is done on the part of the author. As a general
rule, Johns suggests that writers, "take a guarded stance ... when presenting
argumentation and results"[@johns]. Johns understands that playing fast and
loose with the presentation of results can over-promise the value of the
data being reported. In one case of hedging in BHK,
McPherson, introducing some basic configuration of TouchKeys, mentions that,
"the length of time the finger is in motion may differ...In my experience, these
mappings do not feel any less immediate,"[@mit0]. Understanding that the
subjective feeling of touch and tone in music cannot be guaranteed, McPherson
hedges himself against potential negative experiences of those using his invention.

## Absence From Text

While in many cases it might be professional for the author of an article to
remain distant from the subject matter of the writing, in cases where personal
experience is important information for the reader, using third-person language
can come off as awkward or stilted. Though Johns would hope that an author would
remain evacuated from the text[@johns], McPherson understandably takes many 
opportunities to reference himself as an important catalyst for the discoveries made in BHK.
McPherson uses the personal pronoun "I" no fewer than twelve times throughout
the main text of the article along with six instances of the possessive "my".
It is completely understandable that when the author is creating his own
prototypes and describing his own history that some personal pronouns would be
used to assist the narrative. McPherson remembers, "In 2010 I modified a
Moog PianoBar,"[@mit0] as a part of a short anecdote about his personal history
with this project. Were a passive voice used instead to relay this story, it
would have been written, "In 2010, a Moog PianoBar was modified." Though the
true stylistic value of each version is subjective, the passive voiced second
version loses much of its validity and importance to the main narrative.

## Vision of Reality

When Johns defines the aspects of a well-grounded vision of reality, she
understands that it is, "the most difficult of ... requirements, for views of
reality are often implicit"[@johns]. Judging just how solid an author's vision 
of reality is can be subjective and depend on the field the reader is a part of
as well as the kind of results the article reveals.
